Hi [SITE_OWNER],

I love your website and was hoping to donate some Banano digital currency to you. However I noticed your website is not enabled for BananoDonate. It's very easy to get enabled and you can learn how to do so at the following link (no sign-up required): <a href="https://github.com/sebrock/banano-donate/tree/banano-dev#how-can-i-receive-donations-through-bananodonate" target="_blank">link</a>
